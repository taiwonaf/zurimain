        Your personal information will only be kept by us for as long as
        it&apos;s required to fulfill the goals outlined in this privacy
        statement. For the life of the project and for as long beyond that as is
        necessary to conduct analyses, reply to peer review, or otherwise verify
        the input, Meta will keep the information it has collected from you when
        you take part in a feedback panel or feedback research. To the extent
        necessary to comply with our legal duties (for instance, if we must keep
        your personal information to comply with applicable legislation), to
        settle disputes, and to enforce our conditions, Meta will store and
        utilize your personal information. Once this period of time for
        retention has expired and we no longer have a clear need to keep that
        personal information on file, the relevant personal information will be
        deleted.

      <Text className={classes.paragraph}>
        We collect your email address as well as basic information like as your
        name, job title, organization name, and phone number when you, for
        example, seek information about our products, including Workplace,
        download resources, sign up for marketing mailings, request a free
        trial, or attend one of our events or conventions. You won&apos;t be
        able to, for instance, create an account to begin your free Workplace
        trial if you don&apos;t give us this information. When you agree to
        receive marketing-related electronic messages from us and are the

        For instance, if you experience a problem while using one of our sites,
        you can give us any information you deem necessary to resolve the
        problem including contact information (e.g., an email address). You
        could, for instance, write us an email containing details on the
        functionality of our website or other problems. Similar to this, you can
        provide us with information about your workplace or other details to
        help us answer to your inquiry if you ask us for details about, say, the
        Workplace Services.

        with outside service providers who manage our surveys and feedback
        panels, such as hosting a group of Workplace users who have chosen to
        join a panel. In certain situations, these businesses give us the data
        they gather about you, such as your age, gender, email, information
        about your job function and how you use our products, as well as any
        comments you may provide.
